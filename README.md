The Russell Sabia Portfolio Site
================================

Hello, my name is Russ, and welcome to the source code for 
russellsabia.com, my portfolio site. I am web developer who 
loves good design, creativity, and functionality. I tried to
express these things on my portfolio site, so I hope you
enjoy it.

Who am I, what do I do?
---------------------------------------------------------

I am a full-stack web developer who loves learning new
technologies as often as I can. I also enjoy tackling any coding,
design, or layout problem simply because I don't know how to solve
it yet (key word yet). Currently my coding skill include:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- jQuery
- REACT
- Redux
- Node.js
- ES6

I have also worked with several other framework, database, 
and deployment technologies including: 

- AWS S3 buckets
- AWS Lambda
- Heroku deployments
- Netlify deployments
- REACT Bootsrap 
- Firebase Authentication 
- Firebase DB
- Mongoose DB

Am I open to new opportunities?
================================

How can I say this professionally, HECK YEAH!!!

My journey as a developer was only made possible thanks to 
having great coding mentors, going to an awesome full-stack 
boot-camp, and always staying open to learning new things. 
While I am always coding and building new projects, I am 
looking for a place where I can contribute my skills to a
team, while also learning from some great people so I can
grow as a developer. 

Shout out to Thinkful for the great mentors and year of awesome coding!!!

Functionality of this site
==========================

While I love using all types of web technologies to build apps and websites,
I wanted to keep this portfolio site as simple as possible while also being
unique. To do this it was built using only HTML5, CSS3, and minimal Javascript.
Even the neon light animations and entire menu are pure CSS.
