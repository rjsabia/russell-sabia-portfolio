Who am I, what do I do?
---------------------------------------------------------

I am a full-stack web developer who loves learning new
technologies as often as I can. I also enjoy tackling any coding,
design, or layout problem simply because I don't know how to solve
it yet (key word yet). Currently my coding skills include:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- jQuery
- REACT
- Redux
- Node.js
- ES6

I have also worked with several other frameworks, databases, 
and deployment technologies including: 

- AWS S3 buckets
- AWS Lambda
- Heroku deployments
- Netlify deployments
- REACT Bootsrap 
- Firebase Authentication 
- Firebase DB
- Mongoose DB

Am I open to new opportunities?
================================

How can I say this professionally, HECK YEAH!!!
------------------------------------------------

My journey as a developer was only made possible thanks to 
having great coding mentors, going to an awesome full-stack 
boot-camp, and always staying open to learning new things. 
While I'm consistently coding and building new projects, I am 
actively looking for a place where I can contribute my skills 
to a team, while also learning from some great people so I can
grow as a developer. 

Shout out to Thinkful for the great mentors and year of awesome coding and learning!!!

Functionality of this site
==========================

While I love using all types of web technologies to build apps and websites,
I wanted to keep this portfolio site as simple as possible while also being
unique and functional. To do this it was built using only HTML5, CSS3, and 
minimal Javascript. Even the neon light animations and entire menu are pure CSS.

While there are dozens of repo's in my Github account, I tried to only
plug in some of the more fun and functional ones. These project also 
demonstrate some of my core skill as a developer so please feel free

to the WORK section of the site or select WORK from the the menu.
Once there, you can click on screenshot of the project to jump to a
